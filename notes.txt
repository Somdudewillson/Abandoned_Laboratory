Form Shifter (Active, converts as many consumables as possible into a specified type.  Type dependent on set cycle [bombs->keys->coins->bombs].  Shifting uses less than full charge until cycle resets) [Upgraded form has no charge/timed charge?]

Explosive robot familiar?

Capsule-bases stat-up item.  Some capsule types decay, some don't.

Life/Soul Reactor - temporary stat ups from excess hearts

Phase Shifter (Passive, enemy tears sometimes phase through you and become yours)

Rush Key (Passive, opens boss rush/hush doors, maybe also force open Void portal?)

Enemy ideas:

VR Maw: The VR Maw has Tech X (Because it looks like a VR Helmet), it can fire tears with a ring of electricity around them at Isaac
ElecTrite: The ElecTrite is a electronic Trite then when landing on the ground after jumping, can fire a laser at Isaac from any direction.
Chemist: The Chemist can throw up Beakers filled with different kinds of chemicals (creep) that randomizes every shot. <-- boss version as well
